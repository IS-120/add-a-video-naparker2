| After cloning this repo and opening it in VSCode, copy the following files and folders from your _Grid + Form + Style_ assignment into this repo.<br><br><ul><li>üìÑ index.html</li><li>üìÑ favicon.ico</li><li>üìÅstyles</li><li>üìÅimages</li><li>üìÅabout</li><li>üìÅcontact</li></ul><br>**Make sure that you don't copy any other folders or files, including the `test` folder, the hidden `.git` and `.github` folders, and the `package.json` files** |


## :rocket: Publish on Github Pages

When your assignment is finished, check that is doesn't have any warnings or errors in VS Code (fix them if you find any), then sync it to Github and publish it on Github Pages. Remember to paste the Github pages URL in the repo _About_ section.

| :warning: Make sure to validate your website on [validator.nu](https://validator.nu/).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| It's easier to understand validator errors on validator.nu rather than in Github report. Once your Github Pages is live, copy the URL and paste it in [validator.nu](https://validator.nu/). Check "outline" and "image report" and then select `Check`. Make sure you also validate your contact and about pages. If you have any errors, fix them before submitting your URL to Learning Suite. |

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Post repo URL on Learning Suite

Review the tests below and make sure your repo passes them. If you kept your website consistent with the previous assignments, you should pass all of previous tests. The new tests are listed at the end of the tests.

When you are ready for you assignment to be graded, submit a link to your Github repo on Learning Suite for the **Responsive flexboxes** assignment
